### Description 

- This exercise generates image of the classic PacMan game on-demand with the click of a button.

- When the ***Add PacMan button*** is clicked, it triggers an on-click event and a new pacmen is generated and is given a random velociy and position.
  
- PacMan images generated randomly bounce around the walls of the screen with the click of ***Start Game*** button. This is made possible by using a forEach function which updates position of PacMan on the x and y axis every 20ms.
  
- Finally, collision detection, allows the pacmen to stay within the browser window.  When a given PacMan hits     the edge of the screen, it changes position to stay within the frame of the web page.   

### To Run this Program

In order to run this file, Fork and Clone the repository to your local machine and open the index.html file in a browser.

- Click the Add PacMan button at the top left-hand side of the screen to create PacMan. A new PacMan should                      appear at a random position on the screen. You can create as many as you want.

- Click the Start Game button, to see the PacMan or PacMen moving in random directions and at random velocity across the screen. 

### Future RoadMap

This project can be still be enhanced by 

- making the PacMen images change color as they change directions.
- Popping PacMan which hits the wall.
